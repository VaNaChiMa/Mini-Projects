            <div class="panel">
                <p>Several bee hive products offer their own value as a medicinal treatment, though many people know only about the value of honey—with a sizable portion of Americans just familiar with the commercial plastic bear on the grocery store shelf. These other materials produced by bees can be used as bastions to improve all manner of ailments, from auto-immune disfunction to microbial infections.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>After being diagnosed with Kawasaki disease as a toddler, David Brown was robbed of his sight by the time he was 13. A natural athlete, David eventually found a running guide to partner with—and became the Paralympic champion and world-record holder in 2014 as the only blind person ever to run the 100-meter in under 11 seconds. The 30-minute film portrays the unique brotherhood that Brown formed with Jerome Avery, while the two were ‘tethered’ in training for 15 years. Their inspiring story of companionship and abiding trust transcends the world of sport.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>A South Africa-based nonprofit conservation group that manages 19 protected areas on the continent has secured a donation of $100,000,000. The grant from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation was pledged to African Parks, which manages parks in eleven African countries. One of the largest contributions ever made to conservation in Africa, this commitment will help to expand African Parks’ reach, preserving a significant portion of Africa’s biodiversity for the long-term benefit of local people and the animals.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Millennials are more adventurous with food than Baby Boomers—eating more foreign fare, experimenting with unusual ingredients, and even catching their own dinner—according to a new survey. The study of 2,000 British adults found that during an average week just 36 percent of food eaten by 25-40-year-olds is traditional to their own culture. Seven in 10 of these Millennials say they cook with rare or unknown ingredients, compared to just 7% of those aged 57-75.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>There’s plenty a humorous tale to prove the adage “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” but when one Ohio family accidentally threw their grandma’s treasure into the trash, it was no laughing matter.
                    Unbeknownst to her relatives, the canny granny had stashed $25,000 in cold hard cash in her freezer. While tidying up the kitchen, her erstwhile kinfolk accidentally tossed out the tidy sum along with the outdated frozen veggies.</p>
